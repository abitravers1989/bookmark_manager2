As a MA student:

So that I can view all  my bookmarks,
I want to list links.

So that I can add to my bookmarks,
I want to be able to add more links.

So that I can group my bookmarks,
I want to be able to add tags to links.

So that I can search my bookmarks by group,
I want to be able to search by tag.
